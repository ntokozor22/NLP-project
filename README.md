# NLP-project
This Project is all about Natural Language Processing(NLP).
It started with a tutorial on the python library NLTK which is used for NLP.
After that, I proceeded to build a bag of words model on a list of text,
where i first tokenized the text using the CountVectorizer library
then applied the Support Vector Machine classifier on the tokenized text.

After that I went to look at the yelp dataset, where I got the sentiment of the reviews 
using the SentimentIntensityAnalyser and the roberta model, then went to compare
which model did better,
